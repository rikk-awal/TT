this concept that I'm going to teach you
here this technical
technique
called what I call the note follow
through technique or the note follow
through concept and this is one not the
only but this is one
of my key ways to finding major terms in
the market major tops major bottoms

the first step guys is always
stop hemorrhaging money
I still you're gonna still be a loser
but stop losing it by hemorrhaging money
like the the gushing of money the the
just ridiculous stupid
large losses damaging losses
life-threatening losses that's the first
thing we have to do is stop hemorrhaging
money okay
still losing money but not in that
hemorrhaging way so you gotta slow down
your losing reduce your losing
and then the next step is to start
losing the right way so once you shrink
your losses you still might be losing
stupidly but you're just not losing
stupidly in a big way that's the first
step don't lose in a big way you're
still a loser just don't lose in a big
way
all right and then
the next step is now I'm not losing big
but I'm still a loser
how do I shrink these losses
and then you start working at that level
shrinking the losses shrinking the
losses
and basically the way you do that is
every week you should know what your
average loss per trade is and then if
that's too big cut that average loss per
trade down by 20 25 percent next week
and then do it the next week and then
next week until it gets to a very nice
level
all right
um so those two steps are always your
first steps
stop hemorrhaging Money Stop
hemorrhaging money stop losing big
like in a stupid way then you're losing
regularly now how do I get the regular
losses smaller
and controllable to an acceptable level
this concept that I'm going to teach you
here this technical
technique
call what I call the no follow through
technique or the note follow through
concept and this is one not the only but
this is one
of my key ways to finding major terms in
the market major tops major bottoms
okay now because the market has been in
a downtrend for quite some time
I'm gonna teach this concept to you from
the bottom up but remember everything
I'm teaching you is applicable in the
other direction as well all right so
always remember everything I teach you
can be played both long as a concept by
and short as a concept so
all right but since the market has been
dropping I think it's more relevant for
us to really do the Deep dive from the
bottom up okay because that's where we
are right now right so no follow through
this is the key to finding major bottoms
major not small bottoms because there's
a way to find small temporary bottoms
too but this is the major terms you want
to be an expert
at knowing when a major bottom is in
place in a stock
in the overall Market in a
cryptocurrency whatever you trade boom
this concept is going to be your best
friend all right let's go the no
follow-through event that I want you to
be aware of
comprises of a fat
sizable Red Bar
now you can have
you know some Wicks on either side of
the the the fat bar it doesn't have to
be perfect like this I'm this is just a
drawing right so you can have a little
Wick at the top a little Wick at the
bottom what I'm saying is that there's a
lot of freaking red in the bar okay so
this is not a normal red it's a sizable
red okay
it's more than the
it's more than the little green that you
see as the second bar it's sizable
sizable Red Bar
but if you look at this event that I'm
showing you here that I've drawn here is
that
this bar has zero red after it
now let me tell you why that's
significant
a fat red bar write this down

has like an 80
like an 80
83
82 83 follow-through rate
think about this guys
80
at the time
another red bar follows a fat red bar
that's how reliable these bars are
do you know how
do you know how wealthy you can become
in the markets with something that has
an 82
percent
success rate
it's more it's like being right it's
like being right almost nine times out
of every ten
and sometimes ten times out of every 10
that's how you get the 82 8.2 times out
of every 10. there is no follow-through
the next bar is green
there's no additional rent like what
then the next bar screen
what
okay
that's
still not the special part the second
special part is that the Red Bar
to the left gets totally removed
it doesn't matter which green bar does
it it could be the fifth green bar the
tenth green bar the the second green bar
it could even be the first green bar
but the key is that the red is
completely recouped and the green goes

past
the beginning of the red it takes out
the high
of the Red Bar
so the the three things that I need you
to know what that makes up this event
fat red bar one
two zero follow through no additional
red zero
and three
foreign the green
completely erases completely recoups
completely neutralizes the red by
trading above the red bar that is a

major bottom the odds of the low of that
red bar being Revisited or even breaking
broken is extraordinarily low you have
found a major bottom in your stock and
your option and your bond and your
market and your index and your Futures
Contract and your cryptocurrency
doesn't matter
this fat red bar is supposed to produce
another red bar but it doesn't
I have found that when something
with a high probability
is supposed to happen
but doesn't and the opposite happens the
opposite direction is big
version two is this
a nano follow through
and then boom we take it out
so the first remember the first had zero
follow through
there's not a single ounce of red after
that fat red bar
and the the second version is okay you
got a little follow-through but is that
really follow through
if
all of the red eventually gets taken out
all right
so
version two is allowable a little
follow-through like a little slip
through of the red then boom
all of the red the little one and the
big one is completely annihilated
completely neutralized
it is the neutralization that I would
think that I think is also very
important not to miss guys
it's not just that
the fat red bar produced little to no
follow through this is little follow
through
and this is no follow-through so you'll
often hear me say little to no follow
through it's because of these two
scenarios little follow through

no follow through
okay so we're talking about the little
follow-through now
but please don't miss
this important Point here
the complete removal of all the red is
very very critical and that's your buy
point
it is the removal of the red where you
know now I have zero doubt
this is the bottom
I'm going in
now you can guys I'm telling you
you can pick any Financial item
any stock any Market
go back in the past you can pick any
time frame intraday time frame daily
weekly doesn't matter
and then you can go to Major tops and
major bottoms
in the past
and you're going to see a lot of them
not all of them a lot of them started
just like this
in fact why don't I just show you that
why are we playing around why don't I
show you that
look at the lowest low on the Bitcoin
chart now we're looking at a 15 minute
now we're looking at in one hourly time
frame of Bitcoin
right just take a look at it

fat giant red bar
zero follow through guys now like don't
confuse these Reds as follow through
what I mean by follow through is that
there's no lower red do you understand
follow through is a continuation of the

red these Reds are not continuations of
the red because they're not lower than
the red the initial red so this marked
the major bottom fat red bar
boom there is your entry price

and what's that sound
I want to see people do that for me can
you do that for me in the comments
that's a
Fiat counter
all right we make the Fiat and we
convert it to bitcoin right
just do it for me in the comments I want
to say
so here boom

all right you want to see another one we
can stay on the same chart
look at this one
fat red bar you see the fat red bar
should I move it let me move it to the
right a little bit here
so you have this
fat red bar right

fat red
but one little follow-through that is
why you'll often hear me as I mentioned
before little to no little or no this is

no follow through
and this is little follow through
little or no all right and here's the
little follow-through and
little little
okay and here's the no follow through

little little
all right guys I'm gonna stop teasing
him now
it's crazy it's crazy
and you know guys I'll tell you it even
happens a lot in
these micro scenarios like you see you
See This Bar here this is a Troublesome
bar
this one let me blow it up a little bit
for you this one here that's a
Troublesome bar right there
but it has no follow-through and it gets
taken out boom
you see that
okay
red
no follow through and it gets taken out

this no follow-through concept guys I
will tell you this
when I discovered this
it was
guys it was
like a
freaking bright light
that completely changed my trading world
it was one of those and there have been
there have been a variety of these
moments but it was one of those moments
that caused a paradigm shift and not
only the way
I uh why is my framing is off here but
it was one it was one of those Paradigm
shifts that
changed not only the way
that I saw the markets I mean it just
exploded my opportunities
like I started seeing these things all
over the place
um and
it it just it made me realize like oh my
God
like
this concept gave me the ability with to
be able to with confidence say That's
the Law
do you understand how valuable that is
to have that ability most people on
planet Earth cannot do that
do you know that if you ever got good at
that
that you'd become the million dollar
person you how many firms would hire you
and pay you Millions for your ability to
say that's the low that's the top
this is extraordinarily valuable Traders
and so like when
I got this
it's like wow
oh my God
you know so
there you have it guys the no
follow-through concept now remember that
this is also
uh don't forget that this is applicable
on both sides of the fence as it were
right
so you know you get these fat green bars
right that don't really follow through
look at a little follow through and
that's the top and then a fat red bar
no follow through and that's the bottom
it's freaking crazy right
so there you have it guys
very valuable technical
concept
I told you you must be aware of is when

red
solid red starts to consistently have no
follow through
when red just has a hard time when it
shows up
to give you multiple bars all right and
we've started to see this a lot more
frequently
so I'm aware of that and I want you to
be aware of that
so one of the signs is solid red bars
have a hard time following through
all right nothing's 100 but if you start
to see that consistently
that you have to be aware of the fact
that
you know follow through on these
off the open and boom right you gotta
Beware of the fact that things are
potentially pivoting
to to a market where
down is up
because
for many many months down is down
and Up Is Down
okay
so we're potentially transitioning to
down is up
okay
same thing here with Nvidia
down
is up we're down first is up
all right so
down is up down is up
so okay we got that that's the first
sign that red is having a hard time
following through
okay the second sign is that Gap Downs

rocket rocket
so a stock gaps down
and then Rockets
um
stock gaps down

there's a gap and then Rockets right so
you start to see this consistently
I'm talking about Gap UPS I'm talking
about when they got down
and rock it
so the gap down is being met by an
explosion of demand
all right cap down and rock got down

all right so we're starting to see
that quite frequently and one of them

for instance like PayPal
has really just consistently
been a
Gap Downer and and rock it all the way
back so here are are like look at the
last several you're down some of well
this is the third sign
the first sign is solid red fails to
follow through consistently so that's
sign one sign two you should be writing
these things down or taking a note sign
two is gap down and rock rocket

sign three is drop and rock it all the
way back
drop and rock it all the way back drop
and rock it all the way back
you see drop in rocket all the way back
so
those are the three Key signs that

a pivot back to
a favorable long
Market
is um starting to develop they don't
happen in one day you don't switch from
being a bear
want almost exclusively a bear Market to
being
a bull that it doesn't happen that way
it's transitions
over a period so we're starting to see
signs of that transition
right so you've got those three signs
down
let me know
no follow-through on red
all right gap down and Rock
third sign drop and then Rock and recoup
everything
all right
yeah failure to make new lows can be the
size but the three I gave you that's
really what
qun to hey things are changing now
things are changing
but yes failure to make new lows that's
definitely the key as well
most people who start this are starting
on the wrong thing they're freaking in
the 180 degree opposite direction what
do they start working on what do they
start trying to do make money wrong
wrong
how many times have I told you this you
can't make money at first so knowing
that you can't make money at first you
have to work where work on losing right
you don't work on winning when you
haven't learned how to lose right
because the losses will always be in
your way
your biggest enemy or your losses right
so if you don't conquer the biggest
enemies that are blocking the Promised
Land
they're the ones that are preventing you
from entering the promised land these
big giant enemies they won't let you
enter the promised land but choose you
keep the enemies
but you start trying to get into the
promised land without fighting your
enemies without Conquering the enemies
that are there to block the promised
land from you
so most people have this game completely
wrong right from the start they start
trying to make money
and you can't do that first so remember
the first two steps remember step number
one stop hemorrhaging money you're still
stupid you're still a loser just don't
be a big stupid loser
all right
so once you get that level down then
it's like okay I'm losing regularly how
do I how do I lose regularly smarter how
do I lose regularly even smaller than
regularly
and once you're there
that's a very different plateau
because once you get your losses in
control we can now get down to real
serious business
in the real serious business is what we
do on these Thursdays
do you understand
so we're getting down to real serious
business here by putting together
a handful of very powerful technical
Concepts that can help take us to that
Promised Land but these Concepts will do
you no good until you get your losses
under control stop freaking hemorrhaging
money
and let's start losing more in a smart
way now we can get down to business and
start taking these Concepts we cover
here on these Thursdays
and help be in in allowing these
Concepts to take us to the to the
promised land you got it you understand
what I'm saying
[Music]
this concept that I'm going to teach you
here this technical
technique
called what I call the note follow

look at the lowest low on the Bitcoin

now we're looking at in one hourly time

right just take a look at it

fat giant red bar
zero follow through guys now like don't

you do that for me in the comments
that's a

all right we make the Fiat and we

all right you want to see another one we
can stay on the same chart
look at this one
fat red bar you see the fat red bar
should I move it let me move it to the

so you have this

fat red

you see that
okay
red
no follow through and it gets taken out

this no follow-through concept guys I
will tell you this
when I discovered this
it was
guys it was
like a
freaking bright light
that completely changed my trading world
it was one of those and there have been
there have been a variety of these
moments but it was one of those moments
that caused a paradigm shift and not
only the way
I uh why is my framing is off here but
it was one it was one of those Paradigm
shifts that
changed not only the way
that I saw the markets I mean it just
exploded my opportunities
like I started seeing these things all
over the place
um and
it it just it made me realize like oh my
God
like
this concept gave me the ability with to
be able to with confidence say That's

do you understand how valuable that is
to have that ability most people on

this is extraordinarily valuable Traders
and so like when
I got this
it's like wow
oh my God
you know so
there you have it guys the no
follow-through concept now remember that
this is also
uh don't forget that this is applicable
on both sides of the fence as it were
right
so you know you get these fat green bars
right that don't really follow through
look at a little follow through and
that's the top and then a fat red bar
no follow through and that's the bottom
it's freaking crazy right
so there you have it guys
very valuable technical

Beware of the fact that things are
potentially pivoting
to to a market where
down is up
because
for many many months down is down
and Up Is Down
okay
so we're potentially transitioning to
down is up
okay
same thing here with Nvidia
down
is up we're down first is up
all right so
down is up down is up
so okay we got that that's the first
sign that red is having a hard time
following through
okay the second sign is that Gap Downs

rocket rocket
so a stock gaps down
and then Rockets
um
stock gaps down

there's a gap and then Rockets right so
you start to see this consistently
I'm talking about Gap UPS I'm talking
about when they got down
and rock it
so the gap down is being met by an
explosion of demand
all right cap down and rock got down

all right so we're starting to see
that quite frequently and one of them

for instance like PayPal
has really just consistently
been a
Gap Downer and and rock it all the way
back so here are are like look at the

this is the third sign
the first sign is solid red fails to

sign one sign two you should be writing

two is gap down and rock rocket

sign three is drop and rock it all the
way back
drop and rock it all the way back drop
and rock it all the way back
you see drop in rocket all the way back
so
those are the three Key signs that

a pivot back to
a favorable long
Market
is um starting to develop they don't
happen in one day you don't switch from
being a bear
want almost exclusively a bear Market to
being
a bull that it doesn't happen that way
it's transitions
over a period so we're starting to see
signs of that transition
right so you've got those three signs
down
let me know
no follow-through on red
all right gap down and Rock
third sign drop and then Rock and recoup
everything
all right
yeah failure to make new lows can be the

your biggest enemy or your losses right
so if you don't conquer the biggest
enemies that are blocking the Promised
Land
they're the ones that are preventing you
from entering the promised land these
big giant enemies they won't let you
enter the promised land but choose you
keep the enemies
but you start trying to get into the
promised land without fighting your
enemies without Conquering the enemies
that are there to block the promised
land from you
so most people have this game completely
wrong right from the start they start
trying to make money
and you can't do that first so remember
the first two steps remember step number
one stop hemorrhaging money you're still
stupid you're still a loser just don't
be a big stupid loser
all right
so once you get that level down then
it's like okay I'm losing regularly how
do I how do I lose regularly smarter how
do I lose regularly even smaller than
regularly
and once you're there
that's a very different plateau
because once you get your losses in
control we can now get down to real
serious business

business here by putting together
