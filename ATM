listen to me carefully Traders listen
there are two types of traders in this
world I need you to understand this
there's depositors
and there are withdrawals
there are those who put money in
and there are those who only pull money
out
withdraw withdraw
withdraw
withdraw
which one you want to be
you want to put money in
I want to trade with my own money no
professional puts money in
I'm giving you a way to never put money
in the game I am giving you a way to
only be a withdrawal withdraw from the
game
withdraw the money comes from the
depositors
they put money in and never pull money
out because they're not trained they're
not educated they're gambling they're
guessing relying on those idiotic
reports and news that's where our money
comes from
do you understand this
don't be a depositor
depositors are there for us to withdraw
and we need a lot of them because if you
do this right you start to withdraw big
and you need hundreds of depositors to
support your withdrawals
that is why this industry says come on
in
you can open an account in less than
three minutes
how do you want to put it in PayPal
credit card
we can directly grab it from your bank
account
they make depositing easy
and they tell you yes you can do it the
commissions are small yes you can do it
why for me
only eight percent of this world
withdraw
eight percent of Market participants
would draw 92 percent deposited
what signs you want to be on you want to
deposit your money
all right
I'll take it

all right boom you see the first bar
guys this is boring now this is boring
it's the same formula over and over
again how it's supposed to be freaking
boring don't look for entertainment here
look for boredom I do the same freaking
thing every single day and I'm proud of
it I'm like a monkey
I do the same thing the same formula the
same way buy one penny above the high
stop one penny below the low boom
boom
add on the first red color bar takeout
boom boom take take profits once you
move away from your entry and the 20.
stock drifts back toward the rising 20.
you can continue playing the color game
green takes out red boom here's another
Red Bar Green takes out that red near
the 20. Boom
boom boom

you know this I'm gonna Breeze through
this part
if it's a red bar you do nothing
because if this red bar is down here
that's when it's juicy
boom we're looking for that
but it fits up here in positive
territory in the by location you do
nothing
please understand that this could just
do that and it's nothing
okay now
but if
boom boom
green wipes that red away you get in
there with that twenty five thousand
dollars
you put that stop below that green bars
low and do the same formula the next
color bar play
another part and raise your stop on on
the next big bar raise your stop on the
next color bar take profits away repeat
repeat
repeat repeat repeat repeat

Red Bar in positive territory you do
nothing but if
if maybe not but if
boom 25
000 in stop below the low several bar
move away from the 20 make sure you take
some profits
drift back
color
boom away again out
done
go to the beach go to the park walk your
dog watch television go to the mall do
whatever it is you want to do just a
laptop computer internet connection no
employees
no Partners to rely on no waking up
early in the morning and trekking to an
office
you can trade from your kitchen
your living room your balcony your
toilet from some of the best hotels in
the world on some of the best beaches
from The Amazing Mountaintop over there
to the lake right there as long as
there's an internet connection you are
in business with a simple laptop
computer
look at this laptop
that's what I trade off of I don't trade
off of those big giant monstrosities I
used to I'll be honest with you I used
to do that
but that was before the laptop era began
because I want you mobile do you
understand I don't want you having to
turn this into a regular job where oh I
gotta go back to this location to trade
why let's trade from here
no no I got to go back why because I got
18 different monitors
I want you to be in your trading
business no matter where you go your
family wants to go on vacation to Tahiti
the shores of Tahiti laptop computer in
the back you're in business you never
miss your first 20 30 40 minutes of the
trading day then it's family time
just the best business in the world do
you know how much money you have to
invest to open a restaurant
or a clothing store
or if you're a plumber to start your
plumber business with the equipment then
this and that like just a laptop
computer that's it that's it and you're
in business and yes you do have to pay a
small monthly fee for your platform and
your data that is very true that's your
only cost
every business has a cost right
some people's business you you pay a
travel fee for a month you buy a bus
ticket a train ticket you take ubering
you take taxi cabs right you buy your
lunches some of you have uniforms to pay
for
every business has cost every restaurant
has cost ever this business is no
different you've got a cost
it's a few dollars a day
as a professional Trader for a few
dollars a day scares you then this is
not for you
but it's the best business the lowest
cost business in the world and the most
mobile business in the world just you
and the markets
no one can stop you
no pandemic can ruin your business

it's amazing
and I've been telling people I've been
shouting this message from the rooftops
for the last 26 years of my life
26 years traveling the globe spreading
the gospel of trading here we got
another example
Red Bar sitting right there above those
moving averages
boom boom stop boom
uh-oh red bar again Mark that high off
boom more money away from the 20 period
moving average takes some profits all
right pull back a little bit closer Red
Bar Mark that high off boom boom
I always get on my Traders when they try
to do my boom you know
no it's not bad it's boom
birthday

no boom aggressive traitors
that's what I want all right guys I'm
not even going through this anymore you
know exactly what to do
here's a first bar of the morning boom
boom
boom
you gotta be taking some profits up here
somewhere
and I suggest you don't take everything
you take it incrementally so you break
up that part to the boom boom boom
but we get into all of that with the
with the really thorough training every
day
all right let's talk quickly about
shorts everything I taught you to do
above is just reverse below you get a
red bar that opens below your two moving
averages you're gonna Mark the low
you're going to go short right here with
25 000 you're going to put your
protection above the high and you're
gonna bet that this thing is gonna drop
to the downside beautiful beautiful
beautiful
as I told you this is my preferred play
I much prefer to go short than I go long
now let's take a look at some of the
examples here's
chart of Eli Lilly a big giant Drug
Company in the United States first two
minute bar is opening below both the 20
period moving average and the 200. I
don't have this one blue but you you get
the point
all right there you go you know what to
do with this
boom Mark that low off
boom 25
000 in
boom no boom move away

from your entry in the moving averages
take some profits there please uh oh
green remember you got to do the first
one first green bar boom cracks to low
and there's that sound again
there's that sound

don't you love it
let's do another one you know the deal
just mark this up for me do it in your
mind mark it up Mark it up see like I
told you you should be able to look at
any chart right now
and be like okay Oliver I know exactly
where I what I do
so do it right now I'll give you a few
seconds do it right now I'll give you a
few seconds do it
uh-huh
Martha look yeah uh-huh
where's that stop yeah
I see you uh-huh
ah first color game yeah uh-huh I see
you
oh oh wait a minute wait a minute
let's get paid for walking let's get
paid for walking walk that stop down

oh okay okay I see you I see you I see
you yeah
you got this
Mark the lower the first bar boom into
25
000 as soon as this low gets violated
boom
protection boom
first color violation boom walk that

stop down to the next fat bar boom walk
that stop down
boom
okay where's that next where's that next
green red red drop that stop to the
color
where's the next big bar right here boom
drop walk that stop down

boom walk that stop down
but you're probably taking profits here
away
certainly here
you've gone from narrow
to wide now if anything you're playing
the color game this way
you know this
and you've got this guys nothing else is
very few is left other than just repeat
repeat repeat repeat repeat
gain the experience experience
experience experience experience get
better get better get better get tighter
get tighter get more perfect get more
perfect
and then boom

that's it
you know what to do
look at your tight narrow four I mean
look at your tight state
look at the first bar
mark it off
look at the color play
red takes out green boom
look at Red takes out green boom red
takes out green boom red takes out green
boom red takes that green boom red takes
out green boom where it takes that green
boom how many opera oh my God
foreign

wide gone from from narrow look at that
narrow to now y
'all the game is this way

the beautiful thing about trading is
that it is just repeating the same
formula every single time
now here's one special thing I got to
show you guys look take a look at this
look at this one look at the narrow
state
look at your first bar under normal
circumstances you mark the low
all right
here's a little green bar there
under the green bar you're far away
you're taking profits down in these
areas right
okay
now
take a look at this
I want you to know that if you get a
green bar
under here you do nothing
because the green bar is only
significant there
here it means nothing unless unless

red takes it out
now let's go back to this let's go back
to this chart I want you to look you see
this bar
this chart opens like this
let me show you this this chart opened
right there and moved up first
you see it moved up first let me go back
and show you
so first
it opens the morning here
then first it moves up
to produce a green bar
then it moves down to erase all of the

green
and then it keeps going
so look in reality you have this

scenario
you have the green up first then the red
removal of green inside of the same bar
so instead of the red taking out the
Green in bar number two you have it the
red takes it out in the same bar

boom so now check it out
this is the real professional play
boom green up you're watching this as
it's going
and then you're watching The Green
disappear
boom
and once there's one penny under the
green that used to be there
that's your entry not here
that's called The Hidden green
the hidden green
that green bar is hiding from you right
there
it's hiding from you
it was there
and now it's not it's hiding from you
but we don't even let the hidden greens
go by now this is an advanced technique

find the next hidden green
go down a few bars look at a move up
green and then in the same bar a move
down to eliminate the green
do you see it
remember move up
first
then move down to eliminate the green
you see it that's right
move up
green Mark that off
and then

boom that's your first color play right
there

you gotta love it
boom because
this was Green
so it doesn't matter whether the green
gets eliminated
on the next bar or on the same bar it's

the same thing
same bar
same bar
next bar because this bar

is green
doesn't matter we're in equal
opportunity Trader

we don't discriminate
boom
boom
all right you know what to do here
look at the tight narrow State look at
the green bar beneath
so remember you do nothing it's we're in
negative territory but we got a positive
bar but
boom red finally eliminates the green
that's your entry
stop above the high now you get your
next Green Mark that low
boom mandatory now
get paid for walking
walk that stock down
boom fat bar stop adjustment nice

all right
you know this boom walk that stock down
boom far oh
fart look this is green right
but you're far away now
you better be eliminating the trade
because this deep
is going to
like that
when I tell you that what I teach
happens
so frequently
and so many times a day that you will
never have enough money to play them all
you'll want to play them all
guys you understand that the reason I do
this is because I can't play them all
people say I don't know why do you
recruit Traders
why do you travel and speak and recruit
Traders
I was like you don't get it you don't
understand what do you mean think about
this I'm playing the Elephant Bar in
Microsoft at the perfect location wow
wow what about the Elephant Bar on
Twitter at the perfect location what
about
the tail bar in Starbucks at the right
location what about the opportunity in
apple while I'm playing Microsoft
what about the opportunity in Facebook
the opportunity in PayPal the
opportunity in Uber the opportunity in
Disney the opportunity in Nike I can't
be at every opportunity at the same time
so what do I do
I say look you take this money
let me give you my eyes
my skill
my ability
now I will do Microsoft new to Starbucks

you do Facebook
you do Twitter
don't miss
I won't miss Microsoft you don't miss
Twitter you don't miss Starbucks you
don't miss Facebook
and I freaking grab it all
so instead of me one opportunity at a
time
it's now 70 80 opportunities at a time
every time I'm playing Microsoft some of
those playing Baba someone's playing
Starbucks someone's playing Facebook
someone's playing on my team another
opportunity that I could not get to
that's why I do this
so I make freaking one plus one equal
one thousand I'm a nice guy but this is
not
philanthropy and I will tell you this I
don't sell courses I'm not interested in
selling you a course do you understand
I am tired of people out there saying
Oliver sells courses I don't sell
courses
I recruit Traders
is there a cost to set you up in
business yes of course any business and
if you don't understand that you're just
not a business person
but there's one small call cause for the
rest of your life
one small cause to be in the best
business in the world at a cost low
enough where you don't ever have to
invest your own funds in the business
crazy
a business where you're you can get more
money to expand your business more money
to expand your business I'm not in the
course business I have no interest in
teaching you if you don't want to be a
Trader of mine I did that at pristine
for 12 years
I was the biggest educational trading
firm in the world for 12 years I tired
of that
I moved to funding my own Traders so let
me tell you this I can't control whether
or not you join me and never use my
money
just to learn I can't control that
but that is not why I do this
I do this
and every person I train gets an account
whether you use it or not you get it
because that's my goal I left the
training business
a decade ago so I don't sell I'm not
here to sell you a program I don't do
that
I'm here to get another set of eyes I'm
here to get another player so that I
miss less you miss less there's power in
numbers
this is how firms like Goldman Sachs
have been formed it used to be Goldman
then it was Saks now it's 8 000 freaking
Traders around the world
this is how it's done
the biggest hedge funds are built this
way
this is how you get there and if you
tell me yeah but Oliver these people had
don't pay to join the company these P
these traders that trade for these Wall
Street firms they're actually not they
don't have to pay to get in like what
world do you live in what do you mean
they don't have to pay to get it they
won't hire any person who has not put a
half a million dollars into an Ivy
League Education First everyone pays
they require that you get a degree from
this list of schools otherwise you can't
enter that's not paying for your
education first and then here's money to
trade with that's not paying first
that's paying big first everyone in this
game pays something up front first
and this is no exception but I just
wanted to I just wanted to clarify some
of those silly things like Oliver why do
you teach
because I want to make more money what
do you mean
I me plus you means more money for both
of us
that's crazy
I can only capture one or two at a time
but there are hundreds that are
happening every moment of the day
so when I'm on an airplane
flying to Cancun Mexico
when I get off the plane the first thing
I check is how much you made my team
made while I was on that plane if I'm in
a meeting
and I'm not trading it's the afternoon
as soon as I get off that meeting I
check
how much money
did my team make me
while I was in that meeting this
business this is not courses
