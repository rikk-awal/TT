this is called the three push profit
taking Rule now remember guys I'm
assuming that you know when to buy you
know what to buy
but after you have bought what you know
to buy rule number two
gives you the right to take profits
after what I call three pushes this is
called the three push profit rule let's
delve into it
now the three Pro the three push profit
rule states that after three sudden
individual bursts of new highs in your
profits you earn the right not the
obligation ever to take a profit we want
let's let's assume that you have integer
play here
boom
you're protecting yourself here I teach
my Traders always protect yourself under
the item that you have bought so if we
have bought this item
we're protecting ourselves under that
item now anything from our entry price
if we get
that's push one
that's push two
and
push three right here you have earned
the right to take you have earned the
second right now you can take it all
you see remember the 30 to 50 Cent you
earn a partial right here you've earned
the full right you are fully rich now
you can take it all
here are your choices you can take a
portion or you can decide I'm not taking
anything I think this is higher you have
earned that right Traders you are rich
and in this world when you are rich you
have choices when you are not rich you
don't have choices
all right
so once you hit a 300 gain
you must have something in your plan
that says I now go home with one with no
less than 150 dollars
three hundred dollars and to lose it all
is to be a freaking idiot to be up 300
and lose not only all of the 300 gain
but then to go negative 300 which means
you had a 600 turnaround you shouldn't
even be allowed
all right
the honor and the privilege to ever walk
into a financial Market again ever
not only is this
being an idiot and being stupid it is
the highest level of irresponsibility

how
it's hard enough to become profitable
how is it that you become profitable and
you throw it in the garbage like I would
never give you a s I wouldn't give you a
half a penny of my money I wouldn't give
you a Satoshi do you understand how
small a Satoshi is right now it won't
stay small but you understand how small
it is I want to give you one single
Satoshi
because I know that if you can take
three hundred dollars
and turn it into a negative three
hundred dollars
you can take three thousand and turn it
into negative three thousand
and you can take
thirty thousand and turn it into
negative thirty thousand and you can
take three million and turn it into
negative three million those zeros at
the end of those numbers those extra
zeros don't change you do you understand
you are dangerous

this is something that you should write
down
all right something you should write
down that's a big hint
this should become a rule in your
Trading
Book of Rules
don't take profits
on
big fat bars
take profits below big fat red bars and

take profits above big fat green bars
but do not take profits on fat bars let
me repeat again do not take profits on
fat bars do not take profits on fat bars
now this is more difficult than it
sounds
because a fat bar has exploded your
profits and so many people many Traders
get affected by that huge pop in their
profits and they take but that's the
actually you're shortchanging yourself
so look at when David took all of the
plays off right here he's taking it on a
fat bar and he's missed an additional
fat bar
he's actually missed two bars right so
after this fat bar
he missed this and this

that's huge
right
um so if if you don't take profits on
fat bars look at what happens in this
trade you don't get out on this bar
you don't get out on this bar you
actually get out on that bar that rule
makes you richer
all right you guys understand that no
getting out on fat bars no getting out
on fat bars let me know I want to see
that you understand that
now
uh
what I teach my traders to do
is something slightly
advanced
once push 2 is complete
my Traders are taught
that they can place an advanced order
up here
before
a third push materializes so they
haven't some of the Traders have an
order waiting in in
third push territory
in advance so that they're rooting the
stock come on baby come to Papa Come to
Papa Come to Papa Boom
Prophet taking profit take done now
whether they do that on half or third or
all of it
is their choice
all right so that's a very interesting
point to know all right we got push one
boom push two
throw that order ahead of time into push
three category and root your stock on
come on baby
come on baby come to Papi come to Papi
boom and there you go order filled and
push three territory on one half of my
position let's see what the half the
other half does let's see if the other
half can earn us more as an example or
all of it
Boom Out
your choice
this is the three push rule
now I have to give you some nuances
regarding this rule okay let's look at
some of the nuances regarding rule
number two the three push rule
there is something that I call the
multi-bar slide that can make up a push
so remember I told you that A push is
really sounds like this a push sounds
like this so watch it so push sounds
like this
that's a push
push two
all right
but this is not a push
nor is this a push
nor is this a push so you've got three
little inching up bars or slide bars
they're sliding to they're not running
to a new high they're sliding to a new
high all right
um these individually are not pushes but
if you were to stack those three
together they would make a push like
this
you see what I'm saying
so if you can stack multiple little bars
together enough to achieve the size of

an average push in your stock
you can even take it on the slide
all right
so here's my point you must have
something built in your trading plan
where you have a cut off if that's 300
and then your cutoff is half of that
meaning I can continue Trading
but if I lose I can only lose 150 from
now and then let's say you have to have
a Next Level let's say you bring gains
up to 500 and at 500 you now can have to
go home with 300 and this is how you
control yourself these things Traders
are
these rules become habit forming and
they build responsibility
the problem is that the vast majority of
people out here are trading rule less
there's Anarchy in their trading which
ultimately means there's Anarchy in
their life
I can tell what kind of person you are
just by how you trade I can tell if
you're responsible I can tell if you're
disciplined I can tell if you keep your
promises to your kids to your spouse I
can tell all these things it's built
into What You Do In the Heat of the
Moment In The Market because the market
is nothing more than a replica a
minuscule replica of life you go into
the markets you go into life you go into
the market every day you wake up and you
go into life every day you have to
protect yourself in the market you've
got to protect yourself in life you got
to look for opportunities in the market
when you look for opportunities in in
life you gotta you have to take
advantage and sometimes realize your
games in the market you got to know when
to stop and and take your gains and
enjoy the roses and take a vacation and
you got to know when to do that
now guys I will tell you that that there
are certain rules that I call

um
wealth rules for lack of a better term
so there there are rules that are more
technique oriented
There are rules that save you money
But Then There are rules that make you a
wealthier richer Trader this is one of
those Rich rules this is one of those
wealth rules you will be a wealthier
richer Trader by applying the big bar
rule profit rule I just told you no
profits on or after after big bars now

this the only exception is when you
start to trade with Advanced orders
you may not be able to help yourself so
let's say for instance when David
entered here what if he automatically
through orders for sale down there in
advance before that became a big bar

now sometimes this drop can happen so
fast that you can't cancel these orders

before
that happens but if it's coming to your
orders in the form of a fat bar I cancel
those orders
all right
sometimes it happens so fast and
violently that you can't cancel that's
the only caveat
but get those orders canceled or don't
place them on fat bars
and here's the main reason why
there's over an 80 percent chance that
fat bars deliver more follow-through
think about those odds over 80 percent
of the time of the time a fat bar
produces more of its own color
all right so
this fat bar
is likely to produce
more
than It produced another Fat bar this
fat bar is likely now
to produce more
all right this fat bar is likely eighty
percent or more likely to produce more
you see this green bar is likely this
fat green bar is likely to produce more

over 80 percent chance of fat bars
producing more
this is so accurate that you can
literally just dive into fat bars
knowing that you're going to be right
over 80 percent of the time that there's
more
and less than 20 percent time losses

and that's a huge winning strategy but I
will tell you this
I will tell you this
that at the end of the day if you're
going to make progress
you've got to ultimately stand still
you're going to have to stop moving
stop changing stop flip-flopping
stop switching stop buying another book
stop getting another course stop moving
to another platform stop searching for
another Mentor stop looking for another
seminar or another program and you're
gonna have to one day stop the search
you're gonna have to dig your heels in
and start gaining some Roots right where
you are because you know what you're
going to realize and if you're lucky you
will realize this many people don't that
wherever you go
there you are all over again
at a certain point you got to realize
I'm running from myself that I am bad
everywhere I go and what's the common
denominator all the places are different
but I'm the same
and I'm getting the same results no
matter where I go so
I want this to ring in your ear forever
wherever you go
there you are again
so if you don't like what you're getting
wherever you go
then it's you
you better change you
that's what's beautiful about this game
called trading it is a game of
self-discovery and self improvement and
ultimately self-mastery because if you
ever hope to have any degree of Market
Mastery you're going to have to have
some degree of self-mastery first it
doesn't work in the reverse I was having
this conversation with my Traders today
that nobody wants to change first and
then get results people say well you
know what if you give me results then
I'll start working on change how how
does life work what planet do you live
on
wait pay me first then I'll do the work
really
and and What freaking world
in what lifetime in what light where do
you live
like what am I watching a movie right
now what movie do you live in
what movie am I watching
the heck is what kind of Disney is
this like dude you you have to put
something out before you get something
back you don't sit back and say that's
the problem with a big portion of the
world's population is that things have
moved to the point where people want
first how do you get first before you
give first before you you put forth
something out first if you go to a park
and there's a swing there in the park
right and you want the swing to come to
you don't you have to push the swing
first
then you get the swing coming back to
you
no people want the swing to come back to
them first I'll push when you come to me
like
I do
I can't help people like that
